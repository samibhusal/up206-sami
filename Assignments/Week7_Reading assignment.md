#Parking search caused congestion: Where’s all the fuss?

I liked how the authors of this paper started by unpacking a few misleading assumptions that constituted parking studies. I was in a parking class last year, and we talked about cruising a lot. But we never discussed the fact that most cruising studies focused on places where parking is perceived as a problem. I appreciated that authors’ clarification that people may be circling around for many reasons besides cruising for parking. In addition, the precise definition of cruising--the difference between driver’s actual route and shortest path within 400 m radius of the destination--and the use of GPS traces to examine cruising were equally helpful. 

*Questions for the author*
a. To what extent would we expect cruising behaviors and circling around urban streets to vary with costs of parking? 
b. What were some methodological challenges and considerations involved in developing this approach to measuring cruising?
c. Wondering/little bit of skepticism: If cruising affects 5-6% of automobile trips in the city and less than 1 % of vehicle travel by private car, why is cruising emphasized so much by transportation scholars who study parking?
