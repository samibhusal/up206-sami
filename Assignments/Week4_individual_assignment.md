**Humanitarian Mapathon**
I participated in two sessions at the mapathon. The first one was a humanitarian mapping 101 with James Walker. In these sessions, I learned about OSM and HOT OSM and digitized few buildings. As James Walker and Andy Rutkowski walked us through the genesis of these mapping project ideas, I realized how something as simple as digitizing building is an important step in creating knowledge. As I pursue the journey of urban planning in the US, I am always torn apart by deep data divide between cities in the US and cities in the Global South. When I am in Nepal, I am always surprised to see how little is on the map. This workshop added to what we have been thinking about from the start of our spatial science class: open source tools like OSM and platforms like HOT OSM are powerful ways of overcoming the data divide and mapping places that have been off the map. The second session I attended was the workshop on QGIS. I followed along the instructions by our facilitator and created a map with layers of apartments and grocery stores. I also learned to add a buffer of 400 meters around transit stops in Los Angeles. I also learned a bit on how to geocode addresses and would have loved to learn web scraping data! Both the QGIS workshop and the humanitarian mapping session were powerful ways to be reminded of the commitment of a large community of mappers who believe in collective knowledge making and making maps accessible.
