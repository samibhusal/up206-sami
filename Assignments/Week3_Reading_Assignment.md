Reading Assignment

The OSMnx article blew my mind! I was inspired to see a scholar from the planning department seriously engage in methodological questions of street network data availability and technology. Features of OSMnx will definitely help researchers to a great extent. For example, as a researcher, I find the task of downloading multiple shapefiles and setting them into appropriate projections in ArcMap always tedious. Also, as a scholar from the Global South, I really appreciate that OSMnx makes it possible to acquire street networks for cities of the Global South. I was equally intrigued to know that one could examine shortest possible paths and also  project and visualize complex street networks by constructing a driving or biking network with a single line of Python code!! Boeingâ€™s work with OSMnx is an inspiration to make data usable, accessible, and available. His work informs my own research to commit to accessible knowledge production. 

The second article on the use of big data to model the relationship between gridedness and car ownership was pretty exciting. While we usually hear about the relationship between street design and travel behavior in urban planning classes, I had not thought of a way to analyze gridedness of cities across the US. As Boeing rightly points, the planning implication of his study is immense; mobility barriers and mobility patterns for decades are based on street network design. 


Questions for the author
How do you envision researchers in multiple disciplines to use OSMnx?
How does OSMnx account for informal paths and pedestrian circulation neworks that TIGER data lacks? How often are these street networks updated? How are informal paths captured into OSMnx data?
