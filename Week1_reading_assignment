Eviction Report 2014 by Eviction Defense Collaborative

This report provides an overview of the eviction epidemic in San Francisco in 2014. Authors of this report also describe processes involved in evictions, including unlawful detainer procedures. The remaining section of this report provide simple yet powerful visualization of spatial distribution of evictions in San Francisco. This report analyzes eviction cases by median household income, race, and language spoken. These data tell a familiar finding: households consisting of low-income, non-white, and monolingual residents face disproportionately high risk of evictions.

What I liked about this report was the simplicity of data presentation. Unlike maps in academic articles, I found the map of eviction cases in SF in this report to be engaging and visually engaging. Sometimes maps and other data visualizations are filled with so many labels that understanding the gist of it is difficult, which is why I really connected with this report. For example, from the first look of the map I could tell how eviction cases are distributed by zip codes and across the region. Similarly, other data visualizations were done creatively. This report spoke to me because it was easy to grasp and accessible.
